## Assumptions

1. The Explorer can only move through spaces " " within the maze
2. Only one final route is required to print out
3. The Explorer can move backward in case of dead end
4. The explorer will randomly select an open route to proceed if there were more than one adjacent empty spaces
5. The maze has a sealed boundary and no open walls
6. The Explorer should search for a path from the starting position "S" to the "F" position until it finds one or until it exhausts all options
7. Assume no BDD is required for this sample
8. Assume there is no requirement to find shortest possible path from start to finish.


## TODO

1. Add BDD Cucumber test steps
2. Code refactoring
3. Find path algorithm can be improved for shortest possible path from start to finish.
